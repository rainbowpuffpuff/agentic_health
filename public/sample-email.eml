Dear Member of Parliament,

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed "Chat Control" legislation. This proposal represents a significant overreach and would fundamentally undermine the privacy of all citizens.

While I understand the goal is to combat serious crime, mass surveillance of private communications is not the answer. It is a disproportionate measure that would have a chilling effect on free expression and create a system ripe for abuse.

I urge you to vote against this proposal and to seek alternative solutions that target criminals without sacrificing the fundamental rights of everyone else.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
A Concerned Citizen
