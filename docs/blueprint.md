# **App Name**: think2earn

## Core Features:

The think2earn platform is designed around three primary data contribution streams, enabling a multi-modal, verifiable AI cooperative.

1.  **Biometric Data Stream (fNIRS):**
    -   **Data Contribution:** Users contribute functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data, collected via a proprietary, non-invasive hardware device.
    -   **Verification:** The data is scored for its value in improving a predictive model (e.g., non-invasive glucose monitoring) using a Shapley value algorithm running in a secure environment.
    -   **Goal:** To build a unique, high-value biometric dataset for B2B customers in health-tech and research.

2.  **Civic Action Stream (ZK-Email):**
    -   **Data Contribution:** Users verifiably prove they have taken a specific civic action, such as emailing a public official.
    -   **Verification:** An on-device process uses ZK-Email to generate a Zero-Knowledge proof of the action, verifying the "what" (the action) without revealing the "who" (the user's private data).
    -   **Goal:** To create a verifiable, auditable record of grassroots civic engagement for public policy think tanks and advocacy groups.

3.  **Behavioral Stream (ZK Mopro & Image Metadata):**
    -   **Data Contribution:** Users prove they have completed a positive behavioral habit, such as adhering to a sleep schedule.
    -   **Verification:** An on-device AI uses a combination of image metadata and device sensor data (via ZK Mopro) to generate a proof of behavior without accessing the underlying personal data.
    -   **Goal:** To incentivize and reward positive wellness habits, providing valuable anonymized datasets for wellness brands and researchers.

## Platform-Wide Features:

-   **Verifiable IP & Contribution Scoring:** All data contributions are scored by a Shade Agent on the NEAR blockchain, which executes a Python script to calculate the data's marginal value. This score determines the contributor's share of IP.
-   **Decentralized Storage:** All contributed data is encrypted and stored on Swarm. Access for B2B clients is managed by NEAR NFTs, which function as access control tokens.

## Style Guidelines:

-   Primary color: Saturated purple (#A050E1), reflecting themes of innovation and privacy associated with Web3.
-   Background color: Very light purple (#F3E8FA), maintaining a light scheme to bring out the vibrancy of UI elements.
-   Accent color: Bright blue (#50BFE1), drawing focus and contrasting the primary to provide visual separation and clarity.
-   Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body.
-   Use clean, geometric icons that align with the modern, tech-forward design of Web3 applications.
-   Design the layout to clearly convey the steps of the process and the sense of digital achievement for the user.
-   Employ futuristic animations for ZK-proof generation and blockchain verification to transform complex technical processes into engaging visual moments for the user.
