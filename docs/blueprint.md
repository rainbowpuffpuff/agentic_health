# **App Name**: PolliNate: Sovereign Edition

## Core Features:

- Sleep Ritual: Perform a 'Sleep Ritual' by taking a timestamped photo of your bed, initiating the sleep tracking process.
- Sensor Data Collection: Utilize phone sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, light sensor) to gather non-personal data patterns consistent with sleep overnight.
- ZK-Proof Generation: Generate a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof demonstrating 'sleep-like patterns' without revealing actual sensor data.
- On-Chain Commitment: Publish the ZK-proof as a 'sleep commitment' to a smart contract on the NEAR blockchain and mint 'Dream Dew' tokens upon successful verification.
- ZK-Email Verification: Send an email to a representative using the app interface. Use the ZK-Email tool to prove the email was sent from a verified address to an official contact.
- On-Chain Registry: Record anonymous, verified contributions in the 'Civic Action Registry' smart contract on NEAR using the generated proof.
- Sovereign Storage: Encrypt the bed photo and upload it to Swarm, a decentralized storage network, using NEAR tokens (Dream Dew) for 'postage stamps,' providing the user with the hash (unique address) of their photo on Swarm.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#A050E1), reflecting themes of innovation and privacy associated with Web3.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F3E8FA), maintaining a light scheme to bring out the vibrancy of UI elements.
- Accent color: Bright blue (#50BFE1), drawing focus and contrasting the primary to provide visual separation and clarity.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body.
- Use clean, geometric icons that align with the modern, tech-forward design of Web3 applications.
- Design the layout to clearly convey the steps of the process and the sense of digital achievement for the user, e.g. Dream Journal, Sleep Verified.
- Employ futuristic animations for ZK-proof generation and blockchain verification to transform complex technical processes into engaging visual moments for the user.
