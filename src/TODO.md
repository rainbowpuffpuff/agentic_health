# PolliNate: Sovereign Edition - Boilerplates & Ideas

## Swarm Storage & Glucose Prediction Model

- Implement swarm storage for fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) data.
- Data is collected from an open-hardware device.
- This data will be benchmarked across users to train a glucose prediction model using non-invasive technology.

## Device Acquisition

- Users acquire the open-hardware fNIRS devices using 'Intention Points'.
- Intention Points is earned from:
    - Verified sleep (Proof of Rest).
    - Emailing parliament representatives (Proof of Action - with a monthly cap).

## Data Collection & Model Training

- Users collect data using the open-hardware device.
- They also use certified medical devices for glucose monitoring (e.g., from Abbott).
- Users pair the data from both devices.
- This paired data is used to help train the glucose prediction model.

## Verifiable & Proportional Rewards

- Users get paid proportionally to their contribution to the glucose detection model.
- Employ Data Shapley ML methods to attribute scores to data contributors in a verifiable manner.
