# Git History Cleanup Log

## Date: September 28, 2025

## Issue
GitHub detected 4 large files (50-66MB) in git history that exceeded the recommended 50MB limit:
- `agent_logic/eigen_blood/first_session/first_fnirs_log_part01.csv` (50.5MB)
- `agent_logic/eigen_blood/first_session/first_fnirs_log_part02.csv` (50.5MB) 
- `agent_logic/eigen_blood/second_session/second_fnirs_log_part01.csv` (66.1MB)
- `agent_logic/eigen_blood/second_session/second_fnirs_log_part02.csv` (66.1MB)

These were older versions of split files that were later replaced with properly sized versions (20-23MB each).

## Solution Applied
Used BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove files larger than 25MB from entire git history:

```bash
# Downloaded BFG Repo-Cleaner
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar -O bfg.jar

# Removed all blobs larger than 25MB from history
java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 25M .

# Completed cleanup
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

## Results
- ✅ **Repository size reduced**: 136.43 MiB → 76.36 MiB (44% reduction)
- ✅ **No GitHub warnings**: All files now under 25MB limit
- ✅ **Functionality preserved**: All 11 split files working correctly
- ✅ **Clean git history**: No large files in entire repository history

## Files Preserved
All current split files remain intact and functional:
- First session: 5 parts (20.2MB each)
- Second session: 6 parts (22.0MB each)
- Total: 11 files, all under GitHub's limits

## Verification
System tested successfully after cleanup:
- ✅ Data file reconstruction working
- ✅ ML pipeline loading 2 trained models  
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Real Data Shapley calculations functional

## Impact
- **Developers**: Faster clone times due to smaller repository
- **GitHub**: No more file size warnings
- **CI/CD**: Improved build performance
- **Functionality**: Zero impact - all features working

This cleanup ensures the repository is optimized for collaboration while maintaining all biomedical research data and ML capabilities.
