# Product Overview

**think2earn: Sovereign Edition** (also known as PolliNate) is a Web3 application that gamifies positive actions like sleep and civic engagement through blockchain verification.

## Core Concept
Users perform "Sleep Rituals" by taking timestamped photos of their beds, then the app uses phone sensors to collect non-personal sleep pattern data. The system generates zero-knowledge proofs to verify sleep-like patterns without revealing actual sensor data, mints "Dream Dew" tokens on NEAR blockchain, and stores encrypted photos on Swarm decentralized storage.

## Key Features
- **Sleep Verification**: Photo-based sleep ritual initiation with sensor data collection
- **ZK-Proof Generation**: Privacy-preserving verification of sleep patterns
- **Blockchain Integration**: NEAR protocol smart contracts for staking and token minting
- **Civic Engagement**: ZK-Email verification for contacting representatives
- **Decentralized Storage**: Swarm integration for sovereign data storage
- **AI Analysis**: Genkit-powered photo and data analysis

## Target Audience
Privacy-conscious users interested in Web3, gamification of healthy habits, and sovereign identity models.
